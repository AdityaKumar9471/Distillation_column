Ethanol Concentration Prediction in Distillation Column

Overview

This project aims to predict the ethanol concentration in a distillation column using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various parameters such as pressure, tray temperatures, and flow rates. The primary objective is to create a reliable model that can accurately estimate the ethanol concentration based on these inputs.

Features

Model Training: Training various machine learning models and selecting the best one.
Evaluation: Performance metrics and model evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

Pressure: Column pressure measurements.
Tray Temperatures: Temperature readings from different trays in the column.
Flow Rates: Flow rates of different streams in the column.
